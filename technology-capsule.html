    <br />
    A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry
    capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is
    where you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym,
    cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
