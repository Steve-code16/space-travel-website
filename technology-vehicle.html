    A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to
    carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or
    beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing
    150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
